# Project Movies

This is a multi-page project built in React, where a list of movies is fetched from an API and rendered on a page.

## The problem

We started with fetching all movies in MoviesList and displaying them on the start page. We then used react router to build links between the main page and each individual movie page. On each movie page we fetch som details from the API for each movie, passing movie id as a prop to create custom Urls.
Each movie page has a back button linking to start page.
